## Introduction
We can easily draw shapes by simply giving their position and dimensions.
__For instance:__
1. Drawing a `path` simply requires the __start position__ and the __end position__ of the path
2. Drawing a `circle` requires the __center position__ and the __radius__ of the circle
3. Drawing a `recatngle` requires drawing 4 paths accordingly.

In this project, we create basic shapes __scaled to a map__. The shapes will be positioned at a particular position with respect to the map
